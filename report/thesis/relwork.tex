\section{GPU Application Characterization}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Usually see Application not as a set of different kernels and ignore kernel "interactions"...
	\item ... or go down to instruction/warp 
	\item ... or look at architectural impacts on applications
	\item A Characterization and Analysis of PTX Kernels
	Andrew Kerr, Gregory Diamos, and Sudhakar Yalamanchili: Broad overview on many applications. Simulated PTX execution, Memory Intesity, branch divergence etc.
	\item Most other Papers analyse on similar levels, focussing on different Application or Architecture Aspects
\end{itemize}
\section{GPU Code Instrumentation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Works on PTX Level
	\item 
\end{itemize}
\section{MPI Communication Traces}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not the same because Message Passing != Shared Memory
	\item Communication Patterns: Rolf Riesen: Paper on Communication Analysis and Patterns, not focussing on special Applications or Architectures. Provides useful metrics to discuss communication
\end{itemize}
