\chapter{Evaluation and Analysis of GPU Communication}\label{eval}
Define what communication means in our context. (Write->Read between different CTAs etc...)

--->> Explain hierarchy of analysis. Highest level watches as application as a whole. \\

\section{Evaluated Applications}
	Set of Functions that can display a communicating behavior, tend to be iterative kernels
\begin{itemize}
	\item Histogram (CUDA Suite)
	\item Stencil (Rodinia 2D, 3D)
	\item NBody (CEG)
	\item BFS (Rodinia)
	\item Pathfinder (Rodinia)
\end{itemize}
\section{Analysis Parameters}
\subsection{Communication Classes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item P2P: One Writer, one Reader
	\item Scatter: One Writer, Multiple Readers
	\item Gather: Multiple Writes, one Reader
	\item Synchronization: Atomic access to one Address by multiple CTAs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Communication Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Write-to-Read ratio
	\item Transfer Size Histogram: Data Transferred in one Communication between two CTAs
	\item Transfer Density: Number of Communications(one Write->Read relation) between CTAs in whole application
	\item Volume Density: Number of bytes transferred in whole application
	\item Sparcity: Stride in data Communicated via Scatter/Gather
\end{itemize}
