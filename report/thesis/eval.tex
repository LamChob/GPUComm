\chapter{Evaluation and Analysis of GPU Communication}
Some introducing words and a paragraph on the issue with Applications using Streams. 

Define what communication means in our context. (Write->Read between different CTAs etc...)
\section{Evaluated Applications}
	Set of Functions that can display a communicating behavior, tend to be iterative kernels
\begin{itemize}
	\item Histogram
	\item Stencil (CG Code)
	\item Stencil (Rodinia 3D)
	\item NBody
	\item Graphs, for more irregular access patterns
	\item Reduction (Included in CG)
\end{itemize}
\section{Analysis Parameters}
\subsection{Communication Classes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item P2P: One Writer, one Reader
	\item Scatter: One Writer, Multiple Readers
	\item Gather: Multiple Writes, one Reader
	\item Synchronization: Atomic access to one Address by multiple CTAs
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Communication Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transfer Size Histogram: Data Transferred in one Communication between two CTAs
	\item Transfer Density: Number of Communications(one Write->Read relation) between CTAs in whole application
	\item Volume Density: Number of bytes transferred in whole application
	\item Sparcity: Stride in data Communicated via Scatter/Gather
\end{itemize}
